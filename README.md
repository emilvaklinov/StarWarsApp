StarWars app
==============================

TASK
----------

Included in this archive is an Xcode project, named StarWarsAPIViewer. This is a basic iOS app that pulls data from the Star Wars API, also known as [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev).

The current implementation launches the app and offers a button to view information about all planets found within the Star Wars universe.

For this assessment, we are looking for you to improve the existing project by adding some features. These are:
    - Add a way to view detail about an individual planet when tapping on an entry in the all planets list
    - Implement a way for a user to refresh the data shown on the screen
    - Extend or improve the project in any way you feel is appropriate. This can be anything from refactoring Objective-C to Swift, migrating to SwiftUI, increasing test coverage, etc

Please do not spend more than five hours on these tasks. We know that this may not be enough time to complete all these tasks, and we do not expect all tasks to be completed. We are more interested in your approach to developing these features, rather than how many lines of code you can produce within a given timeframe.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

The project is built using Xcode 12.5.1, with iOS 14.5 as the minimum deployment level. The app currently runs on iPhone. Further documentation about SWAPI endpoints can be found on the website, https://swapi.dev
